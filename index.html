                        <p>Hello, my name is Kade Christlieb. I am a father to a wonderful daughter and married to my
                            wife
                            Ashley
                            for 3 years. I have many passions in life from anything to do with sports, cooking, all the
                            way
                            to a
                            passion for Disney. I currently live in West Jordan, Utah and I am currently 27 years old. I
                            love to
                            learn new things and am very excited for new adventures to soon come.</p>
                        </br>
                        <p>My education background is that of an Ass.RN. I choose to change my career path as being
                            behind
                            the
                            keyboard has been a strong intrest of mine as a hobby. I started to get into web development
                            a
                            few years
                            ago with just basic messing around with html and css, until I felt like I needed to learn
                            more.
                            I am
                            excited for what I can learn and know that this is just the begining to a long and exciting
                            jourey
                            ahead.</p>
