          <p>Hello, my name is Kade Christlieb. I am a father to a wonderful daughter and married to
            my
            wife
            Ashley
            for 3 years. I have many passions in life from anything to do with sports, cooking, all
            the
            way
            to a
            passion for Disney. I currently live in West Jordan, Utah and I am currently 27 years
            old. I
            love to
            learn new things and am very excited for new adventures to soon come.</p>
          </br>
          <p>My education background is that of an Ass.RN. I choose to change my career path as being
            behind
            the
            keyboard has been a strong intrest of mine as a hobby. I started to get into web
            development
            a
            few years
            ago with just basic messing around with html and css, until I felt like I needed to
            learn
            more.
            I am
            excited for what I can learn and know that this is just the begining to a long and
            exciting
            jourey
            ahead.</p>
