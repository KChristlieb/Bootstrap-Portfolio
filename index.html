                                the
                                way
                                to a
                                passion for Disney. I currently live in West Jordan, Utah and I am currently 27 years

                            <p>My education background is that of an Ass.RN. I choose to change my career path as being
                                behind
                                the
                                keyboard has been a strong intrest of mine as a hobby. I started to get into web

                                ago with just basic messing around with html and css, until I felt like I needed to
                                learn
                                more.

                                excited for what I can learn and know that this is just the begining to a long and
                                exciting
